#This project is an AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System that automates resume evaluation based on a given job description. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system extracts text from resumes, processes them, and ranks candidates using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity.
#Features
Upload resumes in PDF format
Extract text from resumes using PyPDF2
Process text data with TF-IDF Vectorization
Compute similarity using Cosine Similarity
Rank resumes based on job relevance
User-friendly Streamlit interface
#Technologies Used
Python
